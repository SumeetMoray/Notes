Gradle wrapper
- in order to ensure that people use the same gradle version for building the project we use gradle wrapper

execute gradle wrapper in the working directory
- gradle wrapper - generates gradle wrapper for the gradle build in the current working directory. 

- ./gradlew - using the wrapper instead of using the local gradle installation

downloads the gradle version for the wrapper if that gradle version is already not downloaded.
