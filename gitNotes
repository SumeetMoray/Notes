:: Case of different changes done by different people on the same repository. 
git pull origin master 
[ is equal to ]
git fetch origin
git merge master origin/master

when the fetch origin is executed the files form the remote repository is pulled into local repository in the branch origin/master. 
After you execute merge master origin/master the changes in the origin/master is merged into local master branch. 

This way two different people working on the same repository can contribute.
