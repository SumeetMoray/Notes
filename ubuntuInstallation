Ubuntu Installation Routine

- setup Auto Mount : Using "sudo gnome-disks" - GUI tool that can set auto mount
- after setting auto mount using 'gnome-disks' you need to regain the ownership of the internal drive/partition for this type:
sudo chown username:username path-of-disk-mount [-R]
	-R tells to apply this recursively so that all the folders and subfolders get owned by the user

for Example: if username is sumeet and disk is mounted on /media/sumeet/linuxDevelopment then type

sudo chown sumeet:sumeet /media/sumeet/linuxDevelopment
